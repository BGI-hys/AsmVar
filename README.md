Instant plans for further developments
---------------------------------------
1. Evaluations of de novo assemblies with regards to continuity, completeness and accuracy.
2. Assign quality scores to de novo assemblies
3. Improve genotyping module and develop new approaches for greatest accuracy and flexibility.

5. Improvement of de novo assemblies

Contribution
------------
The AsmVar is developed for the DanishPanGenome project in GenomeDK platform. The AsmVar software construction, applications, statistical methods and the evaluation protocols are established by [Siyang Liu](https://github.com/SiyangLiu) and [Shujia Huang](https://github.com/ShujiaHuang), Junhua Rao and [Weijian Ye](https://github.com/WeijianYe) led by [Siyang Liu](https://github.com/SiyangLiu) and [Shujia Huang](https://github.com/ShujiaHuang).  The coding contributions for different modules are written in the source code title. Most of the initial codes are written in C++, python and perl by [Shujia Huang](https://github.com/ShujiaHuang) and perl, python and R by [Siyang Liu](https://github.com/SiyangLiu)(All modules especially SV discovery and genotyping), Junhua Rao (especially SV mechanism), [Weijian Ye](https://github.com/WeijianYe) (especially Ancestral state and Novel sequence) . [Shujia Huang](https://github.com/ShujiaHuang) and [Siyang Liu] takes charge of the software architecture and the efficiency of the algorithms. The AsmVar is under active development at the moment, dedicated to provide population-scale exact breakpoint variants called from de novo assemblies or long read technology such as illumina molecule and CG LFR. This work is supervised by Anders Krogh.
