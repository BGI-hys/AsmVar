Improvement of de novo assemblies \r\n\r\nContribution\r\n------------\r\nThe AsmVar is developed for the DanishPanGenome project in the GenomeDK platform. The AsmVar framework construction, applications, statistical methods and the evaluation protocols are established by [Siyang Liu](https://github.com/SiyangLiu) and [Shujia Huang](https://github.com/ShujiaHuang), Junhua Rao and [Weijian Ye](https://github.com/WeijianYe) led by [Siyang Liu](https://github.com/SiyangLiu) and [Shujia Huang](https://github.com/ShujiaHuang).  The coding contributions for different modules are written in the source code title. Most of the initial codes are written in C++, python and perl by [Shujia Huang](https://github.com/ShujiaHuang) and perl, python and R by [Siyang Liu](https://github.com/SiyangLiu)(All modules especially SV discovery and genotyping), Junhua Rao (especially SV mechanism), [Weijian Ye](https://github.com/WeijianYe) (especially Ancestral state and Novel sequence) . [Shujia Huang](https://github.com/ShujiaHuang) and [Siyang Liu](https://github.com/SiyangLiu) take charge of the software architecture and the efficiency of the algorithms. The AsmVar is under active development at the moment, dedicated to provide population-scale exact breakpoint variants called from de novo assemblies.
